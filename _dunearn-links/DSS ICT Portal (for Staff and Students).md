## For Students
Students, please read the following before submitting for help request. 

#### **Student ICON (MIMS) Issues**

Note that you should reset your Student ICON (MIMS) password yourself by answering the MIMS challenge questions that you have set. 

Reset your password yourself by clicking on **Forgot Password** [here](https://idp.mims.moe.gov.sg/nidp//app/login). Note that you can only self-reset your password if you have already set up your MIMS challenge questions.

#### **SLS Locked Account Issues**

Note that you should only submit your request if your SLS account is stated as LOCKED. If you are not able to log into SLS because you have forgotten your SLS username and password, you can retry logging in using your Student ICON (MIMS) instead. 

#### **PLD Chromebook Issues**

If you experience hardware issues with your Chromebook, you may proceed to submit for help request.

Please submit your help request via the ICT Form B for Student ICON (MIMS) issues, SLS locked account issues or PLD Chromebook issues. 

## For Staff

Staff may refer to the **self-help directory** here for more information. 

If required, staff can request assistance for ICT (admin matters/ fault reporting) via the **ICT Form A** [here](https://forms.moe.edu.sg/forms/Jb1xwv).
