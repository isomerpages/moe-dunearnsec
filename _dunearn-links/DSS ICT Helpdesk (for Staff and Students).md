## ICT Helpdesk for Students
Students, please click on the respective links below if you need help with PLD Chromebook issues, Student ICON (MIMS) issues or SLS locked account issues.

#### **PLD Chromebook Hardware Issues**

Please click [here](https://forms.moe.edu.sg/forms/ePyqzv) to submit your request.

#### **SLS Locked Account Issues**

Note that you should only submit your request if your SLS account is stated as LOCKED. If you are not able to log into SLS because you have forgotten your SLS username and password, you can retry logging in using your Student ICON (MIMS) instead. 

Please click [here](https://forms.moe.edu.sg/forms/vRlrOo) to submit your request.

#### **Student ICON (MIMS) Issues**

Note that you should reset your Student ICON (MIMS) password yourself by answering the MIMS challenge questions that you have set. 

Reset your password yourself by clicking on **Forgot Password** [here](https://idp.mims.moe.gov.sg/nidp//app/login).

If you really have problems resetting your password yourself, you may submit your request for assistance [here](https://forms.moe.edu.sg/forms/JAnG8o).
