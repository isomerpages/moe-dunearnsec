<p>Sports safety is an important area in schools. The school adheres to guidelines
laid out by MOE as well as the Singapore Sports Council.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>ADVISORY NOTE: CYCLING TO SCHOOL</h4>
<p>Cycling is a lifestyle choice; MOE does not consider cycling as a core
life skill that schools need to teach to students. While MOE promotes programmes
on cycling safety for students who are already cyclists,&nbsp;<strong>our school does not promote cycling as a means of transport to and from schools.</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are discouraged to cycle to and from school as the traffic conditions
around the school’s location is not ideal for cycling. We encourage our
students to cycle at safe and designated places, such as the parks and
the park connectors.</p>
<p>However, should a child is allowed to cycle to school from home, please
take note of the following:</p>
<p>1. Given the hazards that cyclists may encounter, the school is concerned
about the safety of students who cycle to school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;It is thus important for parents to remind their child to take
the necessary safety precautions, including but not limited to the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Before cycling to school, always make sure that the bicycle is in good
working condition. Bicycles should ideally be fitted with front and rear
lights and a bell. Parent or child should ensure that the bicycle’s brakes,
chains, tires, lights and bell are well-maintained and are in good working
order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A child who cycles to school should always wear protective gear, such
as a helmet, proper shoes (if there are shoelaces, they should be properly
tied), and elbow and knee pads to protect against injuries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;A child who cycles to school should be reminded not to use his or
her mobile phone, even with an in-ear attachment, or listen to music through
earphones while cycling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3. A child who cycles to school is advised to secure his or her bicycle
at the bicycle racks located on the school premises. The school will not
be responsible for the loss of, or any damage, to the child’s bicycle.</p>
