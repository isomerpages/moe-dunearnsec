<h4>Aims of CCAs</h4>

<h4>Recognition of Students' Co-Curricular Attainment</h4>
<p>At the end of the graduating year, the student&rsquo;s co-curricular attainment will be recognised according to the table below. The co-curricular attainment will be translated to bonus point(s) which can be used for admission to Junior Colleges / Polytechnics / Institutes of Technical Education (JC/Poly/ITE).</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">i. At least Level 2 in three domains;<br />ii. At least Level 2 in one domain and at least Level 3 in another domain; or<br />iii. At least Level 4 in one domain.</p>
<p>A Fair co-curricular attainment will not translate into any bonus points as the student has not met the minimum criteria for a Good co-curricular attainment.</p>
<h4>CCA Grading System</h4>
