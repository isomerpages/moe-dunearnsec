<br>Charlene has recently completed her Diploma in Infocomm Security Management
at Republic Polytechnic and is currently pursuing a degree in Computer
Science (Digital Systems Security and Cyber Security) at SIM-UOWSC.
<br>
<br>Beyond her studies, Charlene continues to make a greater impact by giving
back to the community. Her efforts have been recognised through the Association
of Information Security Professionals (AiSP) Student Volunteer Recognition
Programme (SVRP), where she earned Bronze (2023) and Silver (2024) awards.
<br>
<br>Even during her days in Dunearn, Charlene stood out as a leader with a
heart. As Student Council President (2020–2021), she not only led with
vision but also proposed community-based VIA projects that reflected her
deep spirit of volunteerism. It is no surprise that the same passion for
service continues to shine through her work today.
<br>
<br>Charlene shared, “I strongly believe in giving back to the community …
technology has the power to improve everyday experiences in essential public
services.”
<br>
<br>Charlene’s journey reflects the strong academic foundation and values
instilled at Dunearn. Her story reminds us that with determination, service,
and vision, Dunearnites can shine on the global stage and inspire others
to dream big and contribute meaningfully.
<br>
<br>Congratulations, Charlene! You have made Dunearn proud. 🙌</p>
