<h4>What is PDLP?</h4>
<p>At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National
Digital Literacy Programme (“NDLP”) for our schools and Institutes of Higher
Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy.</p>
<p>One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised
Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, where
every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed personal learning
device, PLD.</p>
<h4>Choice of PLD</h4>

<p>The school uses the <strong>Acer Chromebook Spin R756TN</strong>.</p>
<p>Bundle total cost with GST:<strong> $573.30</strong>

<p>11.6” touchscreen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Precision stylus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foldable into tablet style</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chrome Operating System</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Combination USB Slot Lock Cable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 year warranty and insurance</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the primary focus of the personal device is on learning, the Chromebook
which operates on Chrome OS, ensures seamless compatibility with major
learning platforms such as MOE's Singapore Learning Space (SLS) as well
as Google's educational platform. Based on the school's pedagogical considerations,
the Chromebook has been found to best meet our students' learning needs.</p>
<h4>Digital Literacy and Cyber Wellness</h4>
<p>The school has measures to enable a safe and conducive learning environment
for students’ use of PLDs for teaching and learning through:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>classroom management and device use routines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>curriculum lesson designs that support students to be equipped with digital
competencies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>installation of Device Management Application (DMA) in all PLDs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Device Management Application (DMA)</h4>
<p>All PLDs will be installed with a Device Management Application (DMA)
to provide a safer digital environment for teaching and learning purposes.</p>
<p>Installation of the DMA will be performed on a new device during the device
handover to the students in school.</p>
<p>The DMA will be uninstalled from the device when the student graduates
or leaves the school.</p>
<p>More details regarding DMA will be shared with parents via Parents Gateway
(PG) when and where applicable.</p>
