<h4>Student Health Advisor Programme</h4>
<p>The Student Health Advisor (SHA) programme is a programme developed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and fully supported by the Ministry of Education (MOE.) The SHA is a qualified professional (e.g. counselling, food &amp; nutrition, sports science etc) or a trained nurse stationed in selected secondary schools. The SHA will provide advice and guidance for the students with health-related issues so that timely intervention and follow up can be offered to them. The SHA may also refer the students to appropriate specialists for further management.</p>
<p>The programme will benefit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students who have general queries or concerns about their health</li>
<li>Students who are overweight/severely overweight and need advice on healthy lifestyle practices (e.g. healthy dietary practices and physical activity)</li>
<li>Students with smoking and vaping habits who are referred for smoking cessation</li>
</ul>
<p>Students may be referred to the SHA by School Personnel, School Health Service teams, and the Health Sciences Authority.&nbsp; Students can also visit the SHA on a walk-in basis.</p>
<p>Should you prefer that your child/ward not participate in the SHA programme, please inform the schoolâ€™s teacher-in-charge.<br>HOD Student Management, Mr Khaidir or HOD PE/CC, Mr John Tan.</p>
