<h3>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Attendance and Punctuality</h3>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All students are required

Teacher on the first day the student returns to school or through Parents
Gateway. Not more than three (3) parent’s/guardian’s letters are allowed

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All students must stand up
and greet the teacher when he or she enters or leaves the classroom.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are not to rest their
heads on the table during lessons and are expected to maintain an attentive
and respectful learning posture at all times.</p>

tablets, etc.), other than school-approved laptops, must be kept in designated
handphone lockers from the start of school lesson hours (7.30 am) till
the end of lesson hours (based on individual timetable). This would include
all timetabled periods such as recess.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mobile devices may only be
retrieved from handphone lockers after the last lesson.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unauthorized possession and
use of mobile devices may result in a referral to the school’s Disciplinary
Committee for follow-up action and subsequent confiscation of the devices.
Parents will be notified, and students are to report after school to complete
a reflection before the devices are returned.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Security and safety of all
mobile electronic devices is the sole responsibility of the student, and
the school is not accountable for any loss of such items.</p>
<h3>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prohibition of possession of weapon / weapon-like items</h3>
<p>All students are not allowed to have any weapons in their possessions.
They are also not allowed to bring any weapon-like item which can be used

<h3>9 .&nbsp;&nbsp; Possession and Use of Electronic Cigarettes (Vaping Devices)</h3>

<p>In particular, a student may be awarded a Fair or Poor conduct grade if
there are significant concerns in areas such as low overall school attendance,
poor CCA attendance (&lt;75%), high frequency of late-coming (&gt;5), and/or
involvement in a serious offence. The school reserves the right to award
the final grade based on overall inputs.</p>
