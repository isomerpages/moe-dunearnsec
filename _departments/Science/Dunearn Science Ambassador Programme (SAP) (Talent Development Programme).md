<h4>Achievements</h4>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The achievements by our students include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>1st runner-up in the Eat Your Farm Competition 2022 </strong>-
Two teams of nine students participated in the Interschool Eat Your Farm
Competition 2022 organised by Science Centre and Republic Polytechnic on
18 Aug 2022. The teams were equipped with knowledge through online workshops
on food nutrition, hydroponics and micro:bit. They were also exposed to
food innovation technologies in an eye-opening journey to Republic Polytechnic.
Using over two months to develop and finalised their ideas and dish, the
teams planned and created a nutritious, sumptuous and attractive dish for
teenagers which feature the hydroponic vegetables that they have grown.</p>

Two teams comprising nine students participated in the Interschool Food
Science Competition organized by Republic Polytechnic and the Singapore
Science Centre. During this competition, the teams attended courses on
healthy food and making of dietary supplements using capsule machine. The
teams used the knowledge gained from the online modules and Lower Secondary
ALP Food Science modules to plan and create a main dish to satisfy the
nutritional needs of busy young adults aged 18 – 35 years old. Over a period
of two months, the teams developed and finalised their ideas, and also
created a dietary supplement to complement the main dish.</p>

<h4>Students Reflections on their experiences in SAP and food science competitions</h4>
<p><em>I had learnt a lot about science and its theories. I am passionate about this programme because it is very interesting and it relates to our everyday&nbsp;life. Through this programme, I learnt that science is a tool I can use to understand the world&nbsp;around me. It provides logic and sense. I also realised that the more we know about science,&nbsp;the more we would be curious and we can start to do research related to science to satisfy&nbsp;our curiosity and improve our knowledge on it. Therefore, I find this programme very helpful&nbsp;and it was filled with new experiences.&nbsp; - Kerrie</em>
</p>
<p><em>Through this competition, I have learnt how to plan meals based on individual preferences and needs. I throughly enjoyed the competition as I was accompanied by students and teachers who are very welcoming and knowledgeable!”&nbsp; - Cheryl</em>
</p>
<p><em>The overall experience was interesting and I had a lot of fun learning through the process. - Chloe</em>
