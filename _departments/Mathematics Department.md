<h3><strong><sub>Our Vision and Approach</sub></strong></h3>
<p>We believe that <strong>every Dunearnite</strong> can be a <strong>confident and creative problem-solver.</strong> We're
committed to helping students understand how mathematics goes beyond numbers,
connecting them with the skills they need for life.</p>
<p>With a forward-thinking curriculum based on the <strong>Singapore Mathematics Framework </strong>and
key Big Ideas in Mathematics we foster <strong>Critical, Adaptive, and Inventive (CAIT)</strong>,
ensuring students are <strong>prepared for real-world challenges.</strong> Our
programmes are designed to develop<strong> self-directed learners, critical thinkers, and collaborators.</strong>

<h3><strong><sub>Real-World Applications</sub></strong></h3>
<p>Mathematics might seem abstract, but it's everywhere! From designing the
latest app to managing your personal finances, mathematics play a key role
in our everyday tasks. Our teaching focuses on turning complex mathematical
ideas into hands-on learning experiences that show students how mathematics
can power the world.</p>
<h3><strong><sub>Big Ideas of Mathematics</sub></strong></h3>
<p>We emphasize <strong>Big Ideas</strong> like <strong>Equivalence, Proportionality, and Functions</strong>,
which show students how different concepts are connected. Through relatable
examples, we make math relevant and exciting.</p>
<h3><strong><sub>Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and Gamification</sub></strong></h3>
<p>Our commitment to <strong>ICT and Gamification</strong> ensures lessons
are interactive and engaging, incorporating both e-pedagogy and technology-driven
strategies, in line with our department's vision to foster <strong>Joy of Learning</strong> in
the Mathematics Classroom.</p>
