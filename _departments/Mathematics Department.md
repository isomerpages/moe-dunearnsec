<h3><strong><sub>Our Vision and Approach</sub></strong></h3>
<p>We believe that <strong>every Dunearnite</strong> can be a <strong>confident and creative problem-solver.</strong> We're
committed to helping students understand how mathematics goes beyond numbers,
connecting them with the skills they need for life.</p>
<p>With a forward-thinking curriculum based on the <strong>Singapore Mathematics Framework </strong>and
key Big Ideas in Mathematics we foster <strong>Critical, Adaptive, and Inventive (CAIT)</strong>,
ensuring students are <strong>prepared for real-world challenges.</strong> Our
programmes are designed to develop<strong> self-directed learners, critical thinkers, and collaborators.</strong>

<h3><strong><sub>Real-World Applications</sub></strong></h3>
<p>Mathematics might seem abstract, but it's everywhere! From designing the
latest app to managing your personal finances, mathematics play a key role
in our everyday tasks. Our teaching focuses on turning complex mathematical
ideas into hands-on learning experiences that show students how mathematics
can power the world.</p>
<h3><strong><sub>Big Ideas of Mathematics</sub></strong></h3>
<p>We emphasize <strong>Big Ideas</strong> like <strong>Equivalence, Proportionality, and Functions</strong>,
which show students how different concepts are connected. Through relatable
examples, we make math relevant and exciting.</p>
<h3><strong><sub>Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and Gamification</sub></strong></h3>
<p>Our commitment to <strong>ICT and Gamification</strong> ensures lessons
are interactive and engaging, incorporating both e-pedagogy and technology-driven
strategies, in line with our department's vision to foster <strong>Joy of Learning</strong> in
the Mathematics Classroom.</p>

<p>Understanding how to manage money is crucial in today's world. By learning
the <strong>basics of budgeting, saving, and investing,</strong> students
are empowered to make smart financial decisions from a young age. Through
these interactive activities, students are given opportunities to <strong>apply mathematical concepts to real-world financial scenarios, </strong>making
learning both practical and fun.</p>

<p>Through these workshops, students are given opportunities to apply mathematical
concepts to create and innovate solutions to tackle challenges beyond solving
equations, such as robotic car racing and projectile motion. In 2024, students
were given additional opportunities through collaborations, such as with
Temasek Polytechnic Makerspace, to apply what they learnt in creative ways.</p>
