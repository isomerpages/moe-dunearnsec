<h4>Objectives</h4>
<p>Our department&rsquo;s strong belief in the statement, &ldquo;&hellip;strong foundation and rich language for all&rdquo; is translated into sound and engaging programmes that would develop our students into critical thinkers and confident learners. We aim to provide all students who pass through Dunearn&rsquo;s gates a wide exposure to rich texts and strengthen their foundation in grammar and vocabulary. Lessons can be dynamic, with group activities, drama, songs and of course, ICT, infused in the pedagogy.</p>

<p><strong>Reading Programme<br /></strong>One period is allocated in the EL curriculum time per week for reading alone. Here, students are exposed to a plethora of non-fiction texts via thoughtfully selected magazines. As media literacy is a vital skill in a fast-evolving world, photos and advertisements quickly lend themselves to robust discussions in the classroom.</p>
<p><strong>Enrichment Programme<br /></strong>We believe that drama is an important element in language teaching and can be an effective tool in imparting a passion for the language. Through a series of specially selected programmes, students will be exposed to elements of drama which can build their creativity and expression. These imparted life skills will in turn boost their confidence for the spoken language, build their creative skills for writing and contribute to positive character building.</p>
<p>Therefore, our Secondary One students will be required to attend poetry theatre workshops which will introduce creative ways to dramatise and present poetry texts. Our Secondary Two students are encouraged to attend external musicals or drama productions organised by the department to expose and deepen their understanding of the performing arts and culture in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment<br /></strong>We also embrace the notion of holistic assessment. Hence, we carefully design a suit of bit-size, &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; assessments that are not the usual pen-and-paper exam-oriented types. We incorporate tasks such as Show-and-Tell, News Podcast, film reviews and even poetry in our assessment to nurture a love for the language in our students.</p>
<p><strong>Literature Programme<br /></strong>We are especially proud of our Literature Programme, that offers &ldquo;Full&rdquo; Literature at &lsquo;O&rsquo; and &lsquo;NA&rsquo; levels. Recognising that a fulfilling Literature experience should not be limited to the texts, our passionate teachers have been bringing our Literature students out regularly to watch plays and take part in competitions such as the National Literature Festival, where we are regular award winners!</p>
