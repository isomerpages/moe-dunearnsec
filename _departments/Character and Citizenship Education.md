<h4>CCE Framework</h4>
<img src="/images/cce1.jpg">
<p>The Dunearn CCE Framework is a structure providing us clear directions and alignment on why we do what we do and how we do it. In Dunearn, students are the heart of what we do. We want to help every Dunearnite to be anchored in core values (Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony), demonstrated through their Attitude, Behaviour and Competencies, so as to achieve the desired outcomes of education in the 21st Century i.e., A Self-directed Learner, Confident Person, Concerned Citizen and Active Contributor.</p>
<p>The 3 colours in the middle triangle &ndash; Blue, Red and Gold &ndash; are linked to the Dunearn school crest.<br />1) Blue represents discipline and steadfastness in character, so we want every Dunearnite to be grounded in core values<br />2) Red represents pupils&rsquo; passion and enthusiasm for learning, so this would be demonstrated in their attitude and behaviour<br />3) Gold represents the ultimate target of our endeavours, which is the DOE in the 21st C.</p>
<p>Hence, while we look forward, we are also grounded in core values and not forgetting our roots and tradition.</p>
<p>One key CCE Pedogogical approach that we use to facilitate students&rsquo; character and citizenship development and reflection is the Experiential Learning Approach, based on Kolb&rsquo;s Experiential Learning Model. Students will reflect on their experience, learn from it, and apply the lessons in everyday life.</p>
<p>We achieve our goals by removing all barriers to learning, building strong character and citizenship, and provide clear guidance in education and career.</p>
<p>Undergirding all our actions are our core beliefs.<br />Our Calling: Belief in Oneself - Every Teacher a CCE Teacher; to Lead, Care and Inspire. Our Future: Belief in Being Part of Something Larger - Student and National Outcomes; Shaping Success of Singapore.<br />Our Culture: Belief in One's Students. Belief in One Another - Culture of Care.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the triangular support structure represents the close partnership we want to establish with the key stakeholders - the parents and community - to ensure the well-being of every child in this school, thereby having a Student-centric, Values-Driven education.</p>
<p>The figures below show how we design our CCE programmes and processes to achieve the level outcomes.</p>
