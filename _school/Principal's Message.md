<p>I am delighted to be appointed by the Ministry of Education as the Principal
of Dunearn Secondary School with effect from 15 December 2024. As the 16<sup>th</sup> Principal
of Dunearn Secondary, I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation
to the past principals, as well as many generations of staff, students,
alumni and parents in bringing the school to its good standing in the community
today.</p>
<p>My mission as the School Leader for Dunearn Secondary is to ensure that
we continue to put our students first. We believe that our students must
be at the heart of choices and decisions we make, as Dunearn Secondary
is more than just a school to our students.</p>

<p>We are an extension of our students’ families and lives and we are a caring
community where students' needs are a priority. We take pride in our culture
of care and believe that every child is important; every child is unique;
and every child can learn and achieve, regardless of ability and background.
With our beliefs as our cornerstone, we are committed to develop all students
holistically, to help them realise their potential, by building on their
strengths and interests.</p>
<p>In keeping with the uncertainties of our students’ future world of work
and life, we envision every Dunearnite to be a gracious life-long learner
with good character, who is ever-ready to pivot and learn new skills to
navigate the complexities and ambiguities of the 21st Century.</p>
<p>Our mission is “<em>Nurturing students to be future ready - Learn with Passion &amp; Lead with Purpose</em>”.
At Dunearn Secondary, we design curriculum and co-curriculum that will
nurture our students into critical thinkers, leverage learning experiences
to ignite and foster the joy of learning as well as develop values-driven
programmes to build strength of character, cultivate attitudes, competencies
and skills to enable students to become productive citizens of society
in their future. We understand that the more the world shifts and tilts,
the greater the need to anchor our students on a set of strong core values
and moral principles. Our school’s R<sup>3</sup>ICH values are the signposts
which guide every action and are encouraged in all facets of the lives
of our students and staff. These values form the bedrock of the school’s
commitment to delivering a holistic education for your child.</p>
<p>There are educators and there are the daily unsung classroom heroes: those
beacons of inspiration that directly touch and transform lives, stir souls
and instill the confidence and faith that many students are lacking. Every
child needs a mentor and champion. Our passionate and committed teachers
do not simply inspire the passion of learning, they are caring and would
go beyond the call of duty, always striving to do the best for our students.</p>
<p>The next chapter of Dunearn Secondary will be an exciting and defining
phase for the school as we look forward to bringing Dunearn Secondary to
her next peak of excellence, aspiring towards a School of Choice for 21st
century learners. Working in collaboration with my staff, students and
stakeholders, I hope that we will be able to create a vibrant and forward-looking
school - the cradle where gracious life-long learners with strong character
are nurtured.</p>
