<p>Welcome to the Dunearn Secondary School website.</p>
<p>To all the new students and parents, welcome to the Dunearn family!</p>
<p>Our school has recently been through a two-year upgrading process, and we are privileged and grateful to be back to enjoy a larger and better state-of-the-arts learning environment.&nbsp;We have a new administration block with special rooms for enrichment programmes, a new indoor sports hall, as well as new facilities such as the ‘Black Box’ for drama and literacy enrichment, and Applied Learning Programme (ALP) rooms for food science and technology.</p>
<p>Our new premises provide an enhanced opportunity to further our mission of Nurturing Dunearnites to learn with passion and lead with purpose. We provide a caring and engaging learning environment for the students, our teachers and staff run programmes and experiential learning for the students inside and outside the classroom. We strive for innovation and effectiveness, continuously improving our lesson and curriculum design. For example, our STEM ALP supplements students’ learning about food science and technology, and the Learning for Life Programme focuses on student character and leadership development. All these endeavours are grounded in the care and guidance of our teachers and staff, who nurture the students through their secondary school years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This all-rounded learning environment that Dunearn Secondary offers is achieved thanks to partnership with our stakeholders. Since its establishment in 1962, our school has benefited from the contributions of alumni, parents, School Advisory Committee and various community partners. They play an essential role in setting the programmes and direction of the school to better the well-being of the students. With their help, and with the dedication of our staff, we will continue to nurture Dunearnites to be their best while contributing back to the neighbourhood and wider community.</p>
<p>Enjoy exploring our website!</p>
<p>Thank you<br>Mdm Tan Miao Ling<br>Principal<br>Dunearn Secondary School</p>
