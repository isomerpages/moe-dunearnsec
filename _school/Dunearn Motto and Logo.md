<p>The stylized Dunearn Secondary School flame in the centre of the badge symbolizes the school as a place of learning and enlightenment.</p>
<p>The three panels forming the background represent the support given by the members of the School Advisory Committee, staff and parents of our pupils.</p>
<p>The polished diamond represents each pupil of Dunearn developed to his/her full potential.</p>
<p>Of the three school colours, red stands for our pupilsâ€™ passion and enthusiasm for learning, blue for the discipline and steadfastness in character, and gold for the ultimate target of our endeavours.</p>
