In 1969, it amalgamated with Dunearn Vocational School to become Dunearn

<p>The school provides a holistic education for all its pupils. We believe
that all pupils have the potential to learn and that, through determination
and discipline, they will achieve optimum growth, in a challenging, supportive
and caring environment. The school received Academic Value-Added Award
(Bronze) for the Express stream in 2007 and the Normal (Academic) stream
in 2009. In addition, the school received the Sustained Achievement Award
for Uniformed Groups in 2009 and 2010.</p>

admin and teaching block were added. In 2024, the school welcomed its first
