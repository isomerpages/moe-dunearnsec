<h4><strong>Our Motto</strong></h4>
<p>Determined and Disciplined</p>
<h4><strong>Our Logo</strong></h4>
<p>The stylized Dunearn Secondary School flame in the centre of the badge
symbolizes the school as a place of learning and enlightenment.</p>
<p>The three panels forming the background represent the support given by
the members of the School Advisory Committee, staff and parents of our
pupils.</p>
<p>The polished diamond represents each pupil of Dunearn developed to his/her
full potential.</p>
<p>Of the three school colours, red stands for our pupilsâ€™ passion and enthusiasm
for learning, blue for the discipline and steadfastness in character, and
gold for the ultimate target of our endeavours.</p>
