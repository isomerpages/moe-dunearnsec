<h3><strong>2024 Direct School Admission (DSA) to Dunearn Secondary School<br>(For admission to Secondary One in 2025)</strong></h3>
<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>
</p>
<p>DSA-Sec allows students to seek admission to a secondary school on the
basis of talents and achievements that may not be demonstrated at the Primary
School Leaving Examination (PSLE). DSA-Sec enables students to enter suitable
academic and non-academic programmes in secondary schools that can develop
students according to their strengths and talents.</p>
<p>Dunearn Secondary School leverages its <strong>Learning for Life Programme (LLP) - Community Youth Leadership (CYL) </strong>and<strong> Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – Food Science and Technology</strong> to

them to apply their leadership skills.</p>
