<p>The school provides a holistic education for all its pupils. We believe that all pupils have the potential to learn and that, through determination and discipline, they will achieve optimum growth, in a challenging, supportive and caring environment. The school received Academic Value-Added Award (Bronze) for the Express stream in 2007 and the Normal (Academic) stream in 2009. In addition, the school received the Sustained Achievement Award for Uniformed Groups in 2009 and 2010.</p>
