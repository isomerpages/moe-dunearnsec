<p>Dunearn Secondary School Environment Champions have actively engaged the school&nbsp;population to reduce, reuse, recycle more, and recycle right.</p>
<p>In line with our continued efforts from Singapore&rsquo;s Climate Action Week in August 2020, and to raise awareness on the urgency of climate change, importance of climate action and adopting environmentally sustainable lifestyles for partners and the community, we would like to encourage parents/guardians to commit a personal pledge&nbsp;<a href="https://pledge.life.gov.sg/sustainable.html" target="">here</a>.</p>
<p>As part of our recycling effort, we would also like to encourage parents/guardians to pass any recyclables and non-functional IT gadgets (E-waste) to the students to bring to school for a collection drive on 18 September 2020 (Friday) in our school. Examples of E-waste include old/non-functional IT gadgets such as hard disk, calculators, phones, digital/video cameras, radios, printers, scanners, keyboards, VCRs, DVD players, MP3 and CD players.</p>
<p>Please also refer to the information below on how you can do your part to save water and make every drop count.&nbsp;Do support us in our effort to raise environmental awareness and work towards a sustainable future!</p>
