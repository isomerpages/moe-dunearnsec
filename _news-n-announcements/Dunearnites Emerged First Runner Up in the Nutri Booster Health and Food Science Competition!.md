<p>Two teams of nine Dunearnites participated in the interschool Nutri-Booster Health and Food Science Competition organised by Science Centre and Republic Polytechnic on 20 Aug 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this competition, the teams attended seven modules of online course on healthy food and making of dietary supplements using capsule machine. The teams used the knowledge gained from the online modules and Lower Secondary ALP Food Science modules to plan and create a main dish to satisfy the nutritional needs of busy young adults aged 18 &ndash; 35 years old. Over a period of two months, the teams developed and finalised their ideas, and also created a dietary supplement to complement the main dish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are proud that the DSS Team 2 comprising of Gerbelle, Chloe, Kerlin, Cheryl and Chaston emerged as First Runner-Up for the competition! Congratulations and well done team!</p>
