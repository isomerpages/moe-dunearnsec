<h4><strong>About Us</strong></h4>
<p>Guzheng ensemble is a traditional Chinese instrument and has a history
of more than 30 years in Dunearn Secondary School. This traditional Chinse
instrument is able to attract both Chinese and non-Chinese student with
its elegance.
<br>Our graceful performers, after months of training, have had opportunities

and Speech day. These budding young musicians have gained valuable stage

but further horning their skills with the instrument. Through consistent
and rigorous training, they have developed self-leadership and resilience.</p>
