<h4><strong>CCA Objectives</strong></h4>
<p>Our primary objective is to establish the library as an enriching hub
for learning and collaboration, fostering an environment that benefits
both students and educators alike.</p>
<p>To ensure the library operates efficiently on a daily basis, student librarians
diligently fulfill their weekly shelving and annual stocktaking responsibilities.</p>
<p>In addition to these routine tasks, the Library Club also fosters collaboration,
critical thinking, and creativity by engaging its members in a diverse
range of activities, including book discussions and research projects.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the club endeavours to cultivate a passion for reading and
lifelong learning among the student body through book reviews, thereby
introducing their peers to a wide array of new literary works.</p>
