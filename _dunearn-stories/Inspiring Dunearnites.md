A well-disciplined leader, she now speaks with conviction and insight. Her mother&rsquo;s initial apprehension about the amount of time and degree of commitment required of Ern Ting has been allayed.

These teachers are just a phone call away and believe strongly that it is only through school-home collaboration that the potential of the child is optimized. For this, Ern Ting&rsquo;s mother is grateful and proud to call her daughter a Dunearnite.</p>
