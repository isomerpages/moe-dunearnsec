<p>In October, a group of Secondary Two &nbsp;students embarked on a meaningful
5-day cultural immersion trip to Hong Kong, where they experienced a blend
of learning, service, and exploration. The programme offered students the
opportunity to understand Hong Kong’s rich culture and vibrant urban life
through a series of thoughtfully curated experiences.</p>
<p>During the trip, students visited a partner school, where they interacted
with local peers and gained insights into Hong Kong’s education system.
They also explored a neighbourhood district, observing daily life, community
spaces and learn about housing and urban planning in Hong Kong. A highlight
of the trip was the visit to Hong Kong Disneyland, where students learned
about hospitality, and theme park operations while enjoying the attractions.</p>
<p>The trip provided students with a valuable opportunity to broaden their
perspectives, strengthen friendships, and develop a deeper appreciation
for cultures beyond Singapore.</p>
