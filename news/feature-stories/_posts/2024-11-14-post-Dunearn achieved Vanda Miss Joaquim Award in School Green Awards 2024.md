<h4><strong><u>School Green Awards 2024</u></strong></h4>
<p>The School Green Awards (SGA) is organised by the Singapore Environment
Council. The SGA is a voluntary environmental programme for schools based
in Singapore, which serves as a platform for students to develop and showcase
their environmental efforts, through customised activities which will help
them gain better understanding of the environment.</p>
<p>Every year, submissions come from preschools, primary schools, secondary
schools, junior colleges, international schools, and schools for students
with special needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;In recognition of our continuous green efforts, our school has achieved
the <strong>Vanda Miss Joaquim Award 2024</strong>. This award is presented
to the schools with an overall score greater than 90% based on the School
Green Awards framework. We are among the 13 secondary schools that achieved
the Vanda Miss Joaquim Award. More information regarding SGA is available
