<h3><strong><u>Work Shadowing Programme</u></strong></h3>
<p>Dunearn Work Shadowing Programme is a unique opportunity for Secondary
Three students to gain insight into the world of work, explore career options,
and develop essential skills required for the job. By observing professionals
in their workplaces, students can better understand their day-to-day tasks
and responsibilities. The programme allows students to enhance their portfolio
to prepare for Early Admission Exercise for relevant courses in ITE and
polytechnics.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Objectives of Work Shadowing Programme for Students:</u></strong></h4>
<p>1. Career Exploration: Work shadowing allows students to explore various
careers, understand job responsibilities, and identify areas of interest.</p>
<p>2. Practical Skills Development: By observing professionals, students
can gain industry-specific skills, tools, and software. Observing professionals
also enables students to build communication, problem-solving, and teamwork
skills.</p>
<p>3. Networking Opportunities: Work shadowing provides students with a chance
to connect with professionals, ask questions, and build relationships.</p>
<p>4. Real-World Applications: Students can see how academic concepts are
applied in real-world settings, making learning more relevant and engaging.</p>
<p>5. Confidence and Motivation: Work shadowing can inspire students, boost
their confidence, and motivate them to pursue their career goals.</p>

<p><em>“I have learnt the use of robots in medical field. It's used to deliver foods to the patients who have been admitted at their wards. I learnt that pharmacy is much deeper than what I thought it was. I used to think that it was just about taking the medication, packing it and giving to the patients but I found out they also play an important role to check if the medication is suitable for patients by checking on a few things such as the medication they were taking previously and that if it would affect the current prescribed medication. They will let the doctors know if there is any need to change the medication or dosages given. I have also learnt that dietitian do not just check the dietary intake of patients, but some are also involved in researching food supplements to help the patients.”- Khaleel Ahmed Afiya Mariam (3 Opal)</em>

<p><em>“Three things that I have learnt through this work shadowing experience is that firstly patience and adaptability, working with young children requires a lot of patience as they may not always follow instructions immediately. I also learned to adapt to each child's unique personality and needs, which helped me to understand the importance of flexibility in early childhood education. I also learned the significance of a structured environment, as I observed that a well-organized routine helps the children to be more focused, which helps the children's development and behaviour in a positive way, through the carefully planned activities.” – Khairunnisa Bte Abdul Rahman (3 Emerald)</em>
