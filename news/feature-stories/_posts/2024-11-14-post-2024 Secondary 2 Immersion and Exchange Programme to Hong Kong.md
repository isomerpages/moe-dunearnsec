<p>The fourth day of the trip included a visit to an organic farm on the
outskirts of Hong Kong, where students were involved in hands-on agricultural
activities. They learned about sustainable farming practices, such as crop
rotation, composting, and organic pest management. This hands-on experience
allowed students to understand the hard work and dedication required to
produce food sustainably, sparking a newfound appreciation for agriculture
and environmental stewardship. As they worked together to plant and harvest
crops, they developed a sense of responsibility and teamwork. They were
encouraged to reflect on the importance of sustainable practices and how
these could be applied in their daily lives to reduce their environmental
footprint. In addition students also had the opportunity to designed tie-dye
tote bags which showcased vibrant colors and unique patterns, created by

and cross-cultural communication. This journey highlighted the benefits
of experiential learning, where students learn beyond textbooks and interact
with the real world. By immersing themselves in a new environment, the
students not only expanded their knowledge but also gained a broader perspective
on global issues and the importance of cultural diversity.</p>
