Dunearn Secondary School is proud to announce that our school has achieved "Vanda Miss Joaquim Sustained Achievement Award" in 2022. This award is the highest tier award for school that achieved third consecutive “Vanda Miss Joaquim” Award. 

Every year, Singapore Environment Council received over 300 Singapore Green Award submissions from preschools, primary schools, secondary schools, junior colleges, international schools, schools for students with special needs. 

The assessment criteria for Singapore Green Award is different and stringent every year. Only schools with submissions of overall score of more than 90% will receive the “Vanda Miss Joaquim” Award. 

Our school environmental programmes and school-wide activities aim to nurture our students to form good environmental habits and involve the wider community and school stakeholders in environmental efforts.
