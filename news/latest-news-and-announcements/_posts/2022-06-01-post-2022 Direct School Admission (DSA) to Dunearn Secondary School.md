<p><strong>2022 Direct School Admission (DSA) to Dunearn Secondary School</strong></p>
<p>(For admission to Sec One in 2023)</p>
<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></p>
<p>The DSA-Sec allows students to seek admission to a secondary school on the basis of talents and achievements that may not be demonstrated at the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). The DSA-Sec enables students to enter suitable academic and non-academic programmes in Secondary Schools that can develop the students according to their strengths and talents.</p>
