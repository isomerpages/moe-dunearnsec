<h3>What We Do</h3>
<p>The Dunearn Parent Support Group (PSG) aims to partner and support the school in developing the character and intellect of their children. We aim to be a</p>
<p><u><strong>Supportive Partner in Education</strong></u></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The PSG complements the school by aligning with the school&rsquo;s objectives, supporting and strengthening the school&rsquo;s programmes to improve our children&rsquo;s well-being and learning.</p>
<p><u><strong>Bridge Between Parents and School</strong></u></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The PSG listens to parents&rsquo; feedback on school operations, practices and programmes, and provides feedback to the school. The PSG also facilitates the school&rsquo;s communication to parents.</p>
<p><u><strong>Magnet to Attract Other Parents</strong></u></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Parents who are actively involved in the PSG are better able to reach out to other parents and involve them. Over time, more parents can contribute to make the school environment more conducive for learning.</p>
<p>We also aim to support Dunearn Secondary School by volunteering our</p>
<p><strong>a) Time</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">We can volunteer our time to design and conduct the school&rsquo;s programmes and events. Supportive PSG members can help to make the school a safe place&nbsp;for our children to learn in, making school life more vibrant and caring.</p>
<p><strong>b) Talent</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">We can volunteer our expertise, talents, individual interests or personal networks. In this way, parents can significantly expand the pool of help available to the school and the PSG.</p>
<p><strong>c) Thoughts</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">We can brainstorm and contribute constructive feedback and ideas to improve the school and PSG. Cluster-wide or zonal PSG forums are a great opportunity to learn and share ideas with other PSGs. More experienced parents can share experience and advice with younger parents too.&nbsp;</p>
