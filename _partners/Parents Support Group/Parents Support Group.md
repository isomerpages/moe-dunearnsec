<p>The Dunearn Parent Support Group (PSG) aims to partner and support the
school in developing the character and intellect of their children. We
aim to be a</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong><u>Supportive Partner in Education</u></strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The PSG complements the school by aligning with the school’s objectives,
supporting and strengthening the school’s programmes to improve our children’s
well-being and learning.</p>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong><u>Bridge Between Parents and School</u></strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The PSG listens to parents’ feedback on school operations, practices and
programmes, and provides feedback to the school. The PSG also facilitates
the school’s communication to parents.</p>
<ol start="3" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong><u>Magnet to Attract Other Parents</u></strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Parents who are actively involved in the PSG are better able to reach
out to other parents and involve them. Over time, more parents can contribute
to make the school environment more conducive for learning.</p>
<p>We also aim to support Dunearn Secondary School by volunteering our</p>
<p><strong>a) Time</strong>
</p>
<p>We can volunteer our time to design and conduct the school’s programmes
and events. Supportive PSG members can help to make the school a safe place&nbsp;for
our children to learn in, making school life more vibrant and caring.</p>
<p><strong>b) Talent</strong>
</p>
<p>We can volunteer our expertise, talents, individual interests or personal
networks. In this way, parents can significantly expand the pool of help
available to the school and the PSG.</p>
<p><strong>c) Thoughts</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can brainstorm and contribute constructive feedback and ideas to improve
the school and PSG. Cluster-wide or zonal PSG forums are a great opportunity
to learn and share ideas with other PSGs. More experienced parents can
share experience and advice with younger parents too.&nbsp;</p>
