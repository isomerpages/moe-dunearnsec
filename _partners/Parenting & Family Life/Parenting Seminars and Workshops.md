<p><strong>Parenting Support Programmes</strong>
<p>There is no hard and fast rule book for raising children, but it is surprising how many familiar parenting problems have very simple solutions. From anger outbursts, tantrums, defiance, unhealthy gaming habits to establishing a regular homework routine &ndash; the issues you face aren&rsquo;t unique to your family. In fact, they are commonplace. That is why&nbsp;<a href="https://www.triplep-parenting.net/global/triple-p/">Triple P Positive Parenting Programmes</a>&nbsp;can help.</p>
<p>Triple P&nbsp;is one of the few parenting programmes in the world that is based on strategies proven by research. It is a multi-level strategy designed to suit various parenting needs as it aims to promote children and teens&rsquo; psychological, social, and emotional competence. Parents who attend the sessions will receive complimentary&nbsp;Triple P&nbsp;resources (subject to terms and conditions).</p>
<p>Dunearn Secondary School has partnered with Fei Yue Community Services, the appointed Parenting Support Provider (PSP) for the Bukit Batok/ Bukit Panjang/ Choa Chu Kang region to support you in your parenting journey.&nbsp;Parents can indicate their interest in Triple P at&nbsp;<a href="https://go.fycs.org/PSS">https://go.fycs.org/PSS</a>.</p>

<p><strong><u>Cyberwellness Talk for Parents</u></strong></p>
<p>Based on our recent parents&rsquo; needs survey, we noted that many parents are concerned about their children&rsquo;s screentime. We would like to highlight our upcoming public programme conducted by&nbsp;cyber-wellness guru Mr Poh Yeang Cherng. Through the talk, parents would learn about the online and gaming risks our children are exposed to and how to take practical steps to manage their device-use so that they do not fall prey to addictive internet habits.</p>
