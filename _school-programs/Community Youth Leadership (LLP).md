<p>Dunearn Secondary School&rsquo;s Learning for Life Program aims to develop every Dunearnite into a Community Youth Leader who is a confident, concerned, self-directed and actively contributing citizen. This is aligned to the school&rsquo;s Strategic Thrust 1 which is &ldquo;Nurturing Leaders through Holistic Development&rdquo; and the school&rsquo;s Strategic Objective 1.4 - To develop leadership in students through four key leadership domains. Aligned with MOE&rsquo;s 21st Century Competencies and Desired Outcomes of Education, the platforms and opportunities allows students to demonstrate and apply their knowledge and skills to lead by serving the community.</p>
<p><strong>Objective of LLP - CYL</strong></p>
<p>Through initiatives organized, students will acquire and demonstrate leadership competencies across four domains such as Personal Leadership, Team Leadership, Community Leadership and Global Leadership. Student leadership development is part of Dunearn&rsquo;s holistic development efforts to develop in every Dunearnite, the necessary leadership skills and social and emotional competencies to:</p>
<ul>

<li>work collaboratively with others</li>
<li>develop compassion for others</li>
<li>develop resilience when confronted with complex situations/issues</li>
</ul>
<p>The programme looks at the 4 leadership domains of Personal, Team, Community and Global across the 3 Tiers for Student Leadership.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier 1 : Cohort training skills on 4 leadership domains</li>
<li>Tier 2 : Needs assessment and Community Youth Advocacy</li>
<li>Tier 3 : Mentoring and Coaching</li>
</ul>
<h4>Leadership Model And Student Leaders</h4>
<p>Dunearn adopts the Leadership Challenge Model (LCM) as a reference for the student's leadership development. The leadership practices are aligned to the outcomes for the difference leadership domains and tiers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To operationalise the framework, the students will go through a series of training, application and evaluation with VIA as the main driver. Other school programmes and events also provide a platform for the application of the leadership skills and knowledge.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Programmes And Activities</h4>
<p><strong>Cohort Leadership Training&nbsp;</strong>- Students from the different levels will undergo a cohort leadership workshop to equip them with the skills and knowledge for the four leadership domains.</p>

<p><strong>Student Leadership Development</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Leadership training for different student segments (e.g. student council, class committee) are also conducted periodically throughout the year. Leaders are inducted to their new roles through the provision of platforms and opportunities to plan and execute the activities. The &ldquo;Leadership Challenge Model&rdquo; is used as an overarching frame to align the objective of the different domains to the leadership tiers. An online leadership module is also available to supplement students with the knowledge to lead the student body.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Appointment and Recognition</strong>&nbsp;- Students nominated for leadership appointments (e.g. Student council, Class Chairpersons, CCA leaders) are officially appointed and recognized during the student leadership investiture. The ceremony also officiates the leadership role students undertake and the handing and taking over of higher responsibilities.</p>

<p><strong>Values in Action</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; As community youth leaders, Dunearnites would have the opportunity to plan and participate in activities that contributes to the school, local and overseas community. Participation in Values in Action (VIA) projects such as service-learning encourages the student to take ownership and identify the community issues they are concerned about, and initiate action among peers to make a difference and improve the lives of others.&nbsp;</p>
