<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Dunearn Secondary School&rsquo;s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is Food Science and Technology (FSciTech). This school-wide STEM programme complements the school&rsquo;s core academic and student development programmes. In view of the growing importance of Food Science and Food Safety in this fast changing world and, in particular, the manufacturing sector, the potential for our students to further their interest through courses at ITE, polytechnic and university are vast and sustainable.</p>

<h4>Objectives of ALP</h4>
<ul>
<li>To appreciate the relevance and value of what is learnt in the curriculum and to develop 21st century competencies&nbsp;</li>
<li>To provide exposure to STEM-related applied learning and careers and to help ignite students&rsquo; interest in pursuing STEM-related post-secondary courses, leading to STEM-related careers</li>
</ul>

<h4>Implementation -&nbsp;Tier 1 Programmes</h4>
<p>The Lower Secondary classes undergo a series of interesting Food Science and electronics-related modules designed by a Curriculum Specialist from STEM INC, a unit in Singapore Science Centre which supports schools in their STEM-related ALP. Learning journeys are conducted for the Secondary 3 classes so that they can gain greater awareness and exposure to the application of food science and technology to real world situations.</p>
<p>We believe our ALP will develop Dunearnites as confident and creative young scientists, who possess critical thinking skills, creativity and inventive thinking, and communication and ICT skills. Further to this, the experiential nature of FSciTech will develop in our students the dispositions associated with scientific literacy.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Tier 2 Programmes</h4>
<p>Tier 2 programmes involve selected groups of students participating in Advanced Elective Modules (AEM) at Singapore Polytechnic (<a href="/school-programs/food-science-n-technology-alp/advanced-elective-module-aem-introduction-to-food-innovation-at-the-singapore-polytechnic" target="">please click here for the link</a>), food science activities, and competitions.</p>

<h4>Our Industrial Partner &ndash; Fraser &amp; Neave Ltd</h4>
<p>F &amp; N food scientists conducted a sensory workshop for our Science Ambassadors in May 2019 in our ALP Room. During the session, students learnt about how food scientists and engineers carry out processes that go into the creation of new and innovative drink products, analysing them using spider-web analysis. The Food Scientists have also been conducting an annual career talk to the graduating students since 2016.</p>

<h4>Feedback from Our Students</h4>
<p><em>&ldquo;I enjoy the ALP programme a lot because I have learnt many new things through the programme. The new skills I have learnt benefit my learning for the future. I hope to attend more of these programmes in future&rdquo;.<br /></em><em>~ Annalisa Look</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I find the ALP programme interesting as during the programme, we learnt about food science, which is surprisingly fun. It is also interesting to conduct experiments with the different ingredients and my favourite experiment is definitely the alginate gummy experiment.&rdquo;<br /></em><em>~ Johnathan Ng</em></p>
<p><em>Having gone through the&nbsp;</em><em>Lower Secondary&nbsp;ALP, I have learnt a lot of new and interesting things such as lighting up a LED bulb using Arduino boards and making your own ice cream. These hands-on activities are not only fun but it also teaches us some knowledge on food science and technology <br /></em><em>~ Kerrie</em></p>
<p><em>From the learning journey, I realised the amount of effort put in for the growing of vegetables such as wheatgrass and thus appreciate them more. One thing I like most is that we got to experience growing some vegetables ourselves.<br /></em><em>~ Asyiqin</em></p>
<h4>Dunearnites Emerged First Runner-Up in the Nutri-Booster Health and Food Science Competition 2021!</h4>
<p>Two teams of nine Dunearnites participated in the interschool Nutri-Booster Health and Food Science Competition organised by Science Centre and Republic Polytechnic on 20 Aug 2021.</p>
<p>During this competition, the teams attended seven modules of online course on healthy food and making of dietary supplements using capsule machine. The teams used the knowledge gained from the online modules and Lower Secondary ALP Food Science modules to plan and create a main dish to satisfy the nutritional needs of busy young adults aged 18 &ndash; 35 years old. Over a period of two months, the teams developed and finalised their ideas, and also created a dietary supplement to complement the main dish.</p>
<p>We are proud that the DSS Team 2 emerged as First Runner-Up for the competition! Congratulations and well done team!</p>
