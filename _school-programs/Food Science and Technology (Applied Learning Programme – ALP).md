<h4>Implementation -&nbsp;Tier 1 Programmes</h4>
<p>The Lower Secondary classes undergo a series of interesting Food Science and electronics-related modules designed by a Curriculum Specialist from STEM INC, a unit in Singapore Science Centre which supports schools in their STEM-related ALP. Learning journeys are conducted for the Secondary 3 classes so that they can gain greater awareness and exposure to the application of food science and technology to real world situations.</p>
<p>We believe our ALP will develop Dunearnites as confident and creative young scientists, who possess critical thinking skills, creativity and inventive thinking, and communication and ICT skills. Further to this, the experiential nature of FSciTech will develop in our students the dispositions associated with scientific literacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Molecular Sciences in Food Gastronomy and Preservation Workshop by our Industry Partner – BioAcumen Global</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May 2022, BioAcumen Global, founded by our very own alumnus Mr Jimmy Toh, conducted a Molecular Sciences in Food Gastronomy and Preservation workshop for our sec 1 ALP students. Along with learning about the different food preservation methods and how alginate gummies are formed, the student had the opportunity to create their own fruity spaghetti that were decorated with frozen dried fruits prepared by the company. Concluding the workshop with by tasting their self-created unconventional noodles, the students enjoyed and learned a lot from Mr Toh, including possible STEM careers. </span></p>

<h4>Our Industry Partner - Fraser &amp; Neave Ltd</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>F&amp;N Sensory Evaluation Workshop</strong></span></p>
<p>In May 2022, students from Dunearn Science Ambassadors Programme (SAP) participated in a Sensory Evaluation Workshop held by Fraser &amp; Neave Ltd (F&amp;N Ltd). With guide from the sensory evaluators, the students learned about the nutritional values of the food products. They even had the opportunity to put their five senses to test and had fun evaluating the strawberry yoghurt drink! They subsequently designed and created their very own yoghurt drinks and presented their products to their peers. Coupled with learning more about STEM careers in the food industry, this workshop was certainly an enriching food science experience!</p>

<p><strong>Feedback from Our Students</strong></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I enjoy the ALP programme a lot because I have learnt many new things through the programme. The new skills I have learnt benefit my learning for the future. I hope to attend more of these programmes in future”.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">~ Annalisa&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I find the ALP programme interesting as during the programme, we learnt about food science, which is surprisingly fun. It is also interesting to conduct experiments with the different ingredients and my favourite experiment is definitely the alginate gummy experiment.”</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">~ Johnathan&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having gone through the </span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower Secondary </span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">ALP, I have learnt a lot of new and interesting things such as lighting up a LED bulb using Arduino boards and making your own ice cream. These hands-on activities are not only fun but it also teaches us some knowledge on food science and technology &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">~ Kerrie</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the learning journey, I realised the amount of effort put in for the growing of vegetables such as wheatgrass and thus appreciate them more. One thing I like most is that we got to experience growing some vegetables ourselves.</span></em></p>

<p><strong>Dunearn Emerged Champion for the Shell STEM Young Innovation Challenge 2016</strong></p>
<img src="/images/alp13.jpg">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two teams of ten students from Dunearn Science Ambassador Programme (SAP) participated in the Shell STEM Young Innovation Challenge at Republic Polytechnic on 21st Jul 2016. The teams took part in the Health &amp; Food Analytics Category and the challenge was to create a healthy convenience food product and packaging for the elderly. More than 20 teams from several STEM ALP schools took part in the Challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The teams spent a period of two months to develop their product and we are proud that the team comprising Siew Mun, Jia Hui, Wei Wen, Jolie and Stephen emerged Champion for the category. The team will showcase their product and receive the award during the Awards Ceremony at the HDB Hub on 24 Aug 2016.</span></p>
<img src="/images/alp14.jpg">
<p><strong>Reflections from students:</strong></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge was stimulating as we had to take into account the many health risks and special diets of the elderly to come up with a new and creative convenience food and drink. It gave us a great opportunity to learn more about nutrition and the food industry and made me more aware of the importance of nutrition and health. I also learnt that developing and marketing a food product is a long process and many evaluations have to be carried before the product is eventually released to the market.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">~ Jolie&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The STEM SHELL challenge taught me a lot about how the food industry works. It gave me an opportunity to dive into business and experience the processes involved in marketing a food product. We were very proud to be able to express our creativity and execute our ideas into a real prototype, and to eventually showcase our final product to the judges. Overall, it was a very enriching experience.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">~ Siew Mun</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the achievement of the Champion award at the Shell STEM Youth Innovation Challenge 2016, the team of five students from the Science Ambassadors Programme presented at the MOE ExCEL Fest 2017, where they shared with the MOE community how the concepts learnt in ALP led to the creation of an innovative product - healthy barley fried rice.</span></p>
<p><strong>Feedback from Our Students</strong></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participating in the MOE ExCEL Fest 2017 was a true privilege for me as I had never thought that I'll be given such an opportunity. The experience really opened my eyes to the interesting world of food science and technology.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">~ Siew Mun</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a great learning experience to be at MOE ExCEL Fest 2017. We had to share information and knowledge that we've learnt to the visitors and this experience really helped to improve my presentation skills. I also had fun with my fellow teammates who managed the booth with me. It was truly a memorable experience.&nbsp;</span></em></p>

<p><strong>Students at Dunearn Secondary School are putting what they’ve learned in their FSciTech classes into practice, including cutting down on eating fast food.</strong></p>
<p><em>___________________________________________________________________________</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since 14-year-old Secondary 2 student Kristy Lee learned about the calorie count of fast food, she has cut down on her intake and is now more careful about what she eats. “I am more aware of what I am eating, how often am I eating it and how many calories the food contains. Do I really need that energy or will it store as fats?” she says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee is a student at Dunearn Secondary School and caloric content is just one of the lessons she’s learned during the school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in FSciTech, or Food Science Technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school started their ALP in 2015 with two objectives, according to Mr Nick Lee, the former Science HOD who is now the Upper Secondary Year Head. “Our first objective is to allow students to appreciate the relevance of their core subjects and experience real world applications. The other objective is to encourage students to look into STEM-related careers and learning opportunities in their tertiary education,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">STEM is the acronym for the field of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school decided to focus on a STEM-related ALP after looking at their students’ profiles and teachers’ strengths. As to why they decided to specialise in FSciTech, Mr Lee explains: “Food is something everyone needs and the nation needs good scientists to provide healthy food and also to raise awareness on what we can eat and what we should cut down on. FSciTech also wasn’t as popular with the other schools so we thought we could raise the profile of the subject.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Lessons to be learned</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since 14-year-old Secondary 2 student Kristy Lee learned about the calorie count of fast food, she has cut down on her intake and is now more careful about what she eats. “I am more aware of what I am eating, how often am I eating it and how many calories the food contains.

FSciTech also wasn’t as popular with the other schools so we thought we could raise the profile of the subject.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Real world results</strong></p>
<p>It’s clear the programme’s first objective of helping students experience real world applications is showing signs of success. While Lee has cut down on eating fast food, her classmate, Cheah Siew Mun, also 14, now takes special care not to keep food in the freezer for too long after a lesson on freezer burn.</p>
<p>“I learned that freezer burn reduces the nutrients in food,” says Cheah. “Before learning about it in class, I wouldn’t know about it and I wouldn’t care, but now I know we’re not supposed to keep things for too long in the freezer because it will reduce the amount of nutrients.”</p>
<p>The second objective of the programme, which is to get students to consider FSciTech as a future option, is also bearing fruit. “I used to think I want to be a doctor. Now that I know about food science, I started looking into it as an option,” says Lee.</p>
<p>Cheah agrees: “I’m very interested in science and I’m also interested in food. I think working in the industry can be very fun.”</p>
<p><strong>Enjoying hands-on learning</strong></p>
<p>The concept of ALP has caught on very well with the students. “I thought it would be just another theory-based subject but it was different and more hands-on so it was more exciting,” says Cheah. “And I began to look forward to it.”</p>
<p>“I used to think food is just food,” says Lee. “Going through ALP has made me change my thinking. You have to think about where the food comes from, and some use technology and chemicals, which is related to science, which is a subject I really like.”</p>
<p>Both students agree that their favourite part of ALP is the hands-on activities. “The class is another break time for me because it’s very relaxing. You get to learn about something new and different. My favourite part is the experiments – watching the teacher demonstrate how to do it and showing us different stuff,” says Cheah.</p>
<p>Their least favourite part? The theory portions.</p>
<p><strong>Plans for the future</strong></p>
<p>The programme is still relatively new and the teachers are planning more and better things for the future. For example, they are looking at opportunities for Secondary 3 students to get out of school and visit industry partners to expose them to possible careers.</p>
<p>Another potential idea being bandied about is a school café venture where students can work on improving the quality of fruit juice. “Perhaps our students can look into how to make the product better. Maybe brand it and market it in Dunearn café and be an entrepreneur. We want them to think about how they can further apply their knowledge. We also want them to explore like young scientists in a safe environment with the guidance of teachers,” says Mr Lee.</p>
