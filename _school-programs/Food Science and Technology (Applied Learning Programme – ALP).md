<h3><strong>Food Science and Technology (Applied Learning Programme - ALP)</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<p>Dunearn Secondary School’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is Food Science
and Technology (FSciTech). This school-wide STEM programme complements
the school’s core academic and student development programmes.&nbsp; In
view of the growing importance of Food Science and Food Safety in this
fast changing world and, in particular, the manufacturing sector, the potential
for our students to further their interest through courses at ITE, polytechnic
and university are vast and sustainable.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Objectives of ALP</strong></h4>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To appreciate the relevance
and value of what is learnt in the curriculum and to develop 21<sup>st</sup> century
competencies.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To provide exposure to STEM-related
applied learning and careers and to help ignite students’ interest in pursuing
STEM-related post-secondary courses, leading to STEM-related careers.</p>

<h4><strong>Tier 1 Programmes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>The Lower Secondary classes undergo a series of interesting Food Science
and electronics-related modules designed by a Curriculum Specialist from
STEM INC, a unit in Singapore Science Centre which supports schools in
their STEM-related ALP. Learning journeys are conducted for the Secondary
3 classes so that they can gain greater awareness and exposure to the application
of food science and technology to real world situations.</p>
<p>We believe our ALP will develop Dunearnites as confident and creative
young scientists, who possess critical thinking skills, creativity and
inventive thinking, and communication and ICT skills. Further to this,
the experiential nature of FSciTech will develop in our students the dispositions
associated with scientific literacy.</p>

<h4><strong>Our Industry Partner – BioAcumen Global Pte Ltd</strong></h4>
<h4><strong><u>Molecular Sciences in Food Gastronomy and Preservation Workshop</u></strong></h4>
<p>BioAcumen Global Pte Ltd, founded by our very own alumnus Mr Jimmy Toh,
conducted Molecular Sciences in Food Gastronomy and Preservation workshop
for our sec 1 ALP students in 2022 and 2023. Along with learning about
the different food preservation methods and how alginate gummies are formed,
the student had the opportunity to create their own fruity spaghetti that
were decorated with frozen dried fruits prepared by the company. Concluding
the workshop with by tasting their self-created unconventional noodles,
the students enjoyed and learned a lot from Mr Toh, including possible
STEM careers.</p>

<h4><strong>Our Industry Partner – Fraser &amp; Neave Ltd</strong></h4>
<h4><strong><u>Fraser &amp; Neave Ltd (F&amp;N) Sensory Evaluation Workshop</u></strong></h4>
<p>Students from Dunearn Science Ambassadors Programme (SAP) have been participating
in Sensory Evaluation Workshops held annually by Fraser &amp; Neave Ltd
(F&amp;N Ltd). With guide from the sensory evaluators, the students learned
about the nutritional values of the food products. They even had the opportunity
to put their five senses to test and had fun evaluating food products such
as strawberry yoghurt drinks! They subsequently designed and created their
very own yoghurt drinks and presented their products to their peers. Coupled
with learning more about STEM careers in the food industry, this workshop
was certainly an enriching food science experience!</p>

<p><em>“I find the ALP programme interesting as during the programme, we learnt about food science, which is surprisingly fun. It is also interesting to conduct experiments with the different ingredients and my favourite experiment is definitely the alginate gummy experiment.”</em>
</p>
<p><em>~ Johnathan</em>
</p>
<p><em>Having gone through the Lower Secondary ALP, I have learnt a lot of new and interesting things such as lighting up a LED bulb using Arduino boards and making your own ice cream. These hands-on activities are not only fun but it also teaches us some knowledge on food science and technology. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p><em>~ Kerrie</em>
</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;From the learning journey, I realised the amount of effort put in for the growing of vegetables such as wheatgrass and thus appreciate them more. One thing I like most is that we got to experience growing some vegetables ourselves.</em>

<h4><strong>Reflections from students:</strong></h4>
<p><em>The challenge was stimulating as we had to take into account the many health risks and special diets of the elderly to come up with a new and creative convenience food and drink. It gave us a great opportunity to learn more about nutrition and the food industry and made me more aware of the importance of nutrition and health. I also learnt that developing and marketing a food product is a long process and many evaluations have to be carried before the product is eventually released to the market.</em>
</p>
<p><em>~ Jolie</em>
</p>
<p><em>The STEM SHELL challenge taught me a lot about how the food industry works. It gave me an opportunity to dive into business and experience the processes involved in marketing a food product. We were very proud to be able to express our creativity and execute our ideas into a real prototype, and to eventually showcase our final product to the judges. Overall, it was a very enriching experience.</em>

<p>Following the achievement of the Champion award at the Shell STEM Youth
Innovation Challenge 2016, the team of five students from the Science Ambassadors
Programme presented at the MOE ExCEL Fest 2017, where they shared with
the MOE community how the concepts learnt in ALP led to the creation of
an innovative product - healthy barley fried rice.</p>
<h4><strong>Feedback from Our Students</strong></h4>
<p>Participating in the MOE ExCEL Fest 2017 was a true privilege for me as
I had never thought that I'll be given such an opportunity. The experience
really opened my eyes to the interesting world of food science and technology<em>.</em>
</p>
<p><em>~ Siew Mun</em>
</p>
<p><em>It was a great learning experience to be at MOE ExCEL Fest 2017. We had to share information and knowledge that we've learnt to the visitors and this experience really helped to improve my presentation skills. I also had fun with my fellow teammates who managed the booth with me. It was truly a memorable experience.</em>
