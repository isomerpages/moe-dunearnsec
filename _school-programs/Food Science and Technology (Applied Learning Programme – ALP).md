<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Dunearn Secondary School&rsquo;s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is Food Science and Technology (FSciTech). This school-wide STEM programme complements the school&rsquo;s core academic and student development programmes. In view of the growing importance of Food Science and Food Safety in this fast changing world and, in particular, the manufacturing sector, the potential for our students to further their interest through courses at ITE, polytechnic and university are vast and sustainable.</p>

<h4>Objectives of ALP</h4>
<ul>
<li>To appreciate the relevance and value of what is learnt in the curriculum and to develop 21st century competencies&nbsp;</li>
<li>To provide exposure to STEM-related applied learning and careers and to help ignite students&rsquo; interest in pursuing STEM-related post-secondary courses, leading to STEM-related careers</li>
</ul>

<h4>Implementation -&nbsp;Tier 1 Programmes</h4>
<p>The Lower Secondary classes undergo a series of interesting Food Science and electronics-related modules designed by a Curriculum Specialist from STEM INC, a unit in Singapore Science Centre which supports schools in their STEM-related ALP. Learning journeys are conducted for the Secondary 3 classes so that they can gain greater awareness and exposure to the application of food science and technology to real world situations.</p>
<p>We believe our ALP will develop Dunearnites as confident and creative young scientists, who possess critical thinking skills, creativity and inventive thinking, and communication and ICT skills. Further to this, the experiential nature of FSciTech will develop in our students the dispositions associated with scientific literacy.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Our Industrial Partner &ndash; Fraser &amp; Neave Ltd</h4>
<p>F &amp; N food scientists conducted a sensory workshop for our Science Ambassadors in May 2019 in our ALP Room. During the session, students learnt about how food scientists and engineers carry out processes that go into the creation of new and innovative drink products, analysing them using spider-web analysis. The Food Scientists have also been conducting an annual career talk to the graduating students since 2016.</p>

<h4>Feedback from Our Students</h4>
<p><em>&ldquo;I enjoy the ALP programme a lot because I have learnt many new things through the programme. The new skills I have learnt benefit my learning for the future. I hope to attend more of these programmes in future&rdquo;.<br /></em><em>~ Annalisa Look</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I find the ALP programme interesting as during the programme, we learnt about food science, which is surprisingly fun. It is also interesting to conduct experiments with the different ingredients and my favourite experiment is definitely the alginate gummy experiment.&rdquo;<br /></em><em>~ Johnathan Ng</em></p>
<p><em>Having gone through the&nbsp;</em><em>Lower Secondary&nbsp;ALP, I have learnt a lot of new and interesting things such as lighting up a LED bulb using Arduino boards and making your own ice cream. These hands-on activities are not only fun but it also teaches us some knowledge on food science and technology <br /></em><em>~ Kerrie</em></p>
<p><em>From the learning journey, I realised the amount of effort put in for the growing of vegetables such as wheatgrass and thus appreciate them more. One thing I like most is that we got to experience growing some vegetables ourselves.<br /></em><em>~ Asyiqin</em></p>
<h4>Dunearnites Emerged First Runner-Up in the Nutri-Booster Health and Food Science Competition 2021!</h4>
<p>Two teams of nine Dunearnites participated in the interschool Nutri-Booster Health and Food Science Competition organised by Science Centre and Republic Polytechnic on 20 Aug 2021.</p>
<p>During this competition, the teams attended seven modules of online course on healthy food and making of dietary supplements using capsule machine. The teams used the knowledge gained from the online modules and Lower Secondary ALP Food Science modules to plan and create a main dish to satisfy the nutritional needs of busy young adults aged 18 &ndash; 35 years old. Over a period of two months, the teams developed and finalised their ideas, and also created a dietary supplement to complement the main dish.</p>

More than 20 teams from several STEM ALP schools took part in the Challenge.</p>
<p>The teams spent a period of two months to develop their product and we are proud that the team comprising Cheah Siew Mun, Ho Jia Hui, Huang Wei Wen, Jolie Er and Stephen Png emerged Champion for the category. The team will showcase their product and receive the award during the Awards Ceremony at the HDB Hub on 24 Aug 2016.</p>
<img src="/images/alp14.jpg">
<h4>Reflections from students:</h4>
<p><em>The challenge was stimulating as we had to take into account the many health risks and special diets of the elderly to come up with a new and creative convenience food and drink. It gave us a great opportunity to learn more about nutrition and the food industry and made me more aware of the importance of nutrition and health. I also learnt that developing and marketing a food product is a long process and many evaluations have to be carried before the product is eventually released to the market</em>.<br /><em>~ Jolie Er<br /><br />The&nbsp;<strong>STEM SHELL</strong>&nbsp;challenge taught me a lot about how the food industry works. It gave me an opportunity to dive into business and experience the processes involved in marketing a food product. We were very proud to be able to express our creativity and execute our ideas into a real prototype, and to eventually showcase our final product to the judges. Overall, it was a very enriching experience.<br />~ Cheah Siew Mun</em><br /><br />Following the achievement of the Champion award at the Shell STEM Youth Innovation Challenge 2016, the team of five students from the Science Ambassadors Programme presented at the MOE ExCEL Fest 2017, where they shared with the MOE community how the concepts learnt in ALP led to the creation of an innovative product - healthy barley fried rice</p>
<h4>Feedback from Our Students</h4>
<p><em>Participating in the MOE ExCEL Fest 2017 was a true privilege for me as I had never thought that I'll be given such an opportunity. The experience really opened my eyes to the interesting world of food science and technology.</em><br /><em>~ Cheah Siew Mun (Sec 3 Opal)<br /><br />It was a great learning experience to be at MOE ExCEL Fest 2017. We had to share information and knowledge that we've learnt to the visitors and this experience really helped to improve my presentation skills. I also had fun with my fellow teammates who managed the booth with me. It was truly a memorable experience.<br />~ Ho Jia Hui (Sec 3 Opal)</em></p>

<p><strong>Food For Thought</strong></p>

<p><strong>Students at Dunearn Secondary School are putting what they&rsquo;ve learned in their FSciTech classes into practice, including cutting down on eating fast food.</strong></p>
<p>Ever since 14-year-old Secondary 2 student Kristy Lee learned about the calorie count of fast food, she has cut down on her intake and is now more careful about what she eats. &ldquo;I am more aware of what I am eating, how often am I eating it and how many calories the food contains. Do I really need that energy or will it store as fats?&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>Lee is a student at Dunearn Secondary School and caloric content is just one of the lessons she&rsquo;s learned during the school&rsquo;s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in FSciTech, or Food Science Technology.</p>
<p>The school started their ALP in 2015 with two objectives, according to Mr Nick Lee, the former Science HOD who is now the Upper Secondary Year Head. &ldquo;Our first objective is to allow students to appreciate the relevance of their core subjects and experience real world applications. The other objective is to encourage students to look into STEM-related careers and learning opportunities in their tertiary education,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>STEM is the acronym for the field of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. The school decided to focus on a STEM-related ALP after looking at their students&rsquo; profiles and teachers&rsquo; strengths. As to why they decided to specialise in FSciTech, Mr Lee explains: &ldquo;Food is something everyone needs and the nation needs good scientists to provide healthy food and also to raise awareness on what we can eat and what we should cut down on. FSciTech also wasn&rsquo;t as popular with the other schools so we thought we could raise the profile of the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Lessons to be learned</strong></p>
<p>The complete programme runs over two years with one term in Secondary 1 and two terms in Secondary 2, where the first term focuses on the food science aspect and the second deals with technology.</p>
<p>The weekly classes last for an hour and the students go through a mix of theory and hands-on activities during the lessons. Some of the things students have learned include how to make fruit juice, testing the electrolyte level of energy drinks and also how gummies are made, which turned out to be a bittersweet lesson. &ldquo;I found out that some gummies are made using chemicals. It&rsquo;s weird and you don&rsquo;t really want to eat it once you find out. But it&rsquo;s tasty,&rdquo; says Lee.</p>
<p>For the technology portion, students will learn basic programming and go through activities such as electronically monitoring the temperature of a product. &ldquo;We want our students to be exposed to electronics, which is a subset of FSciTech,&rdquo; says Mr Lee.</p>
<p>Current lessons are conducted by a STEM educator from STEM Inc, which is a collaboration between Science Centre Singapore and the Ministry of Education, and which was set up to provide support for schools pursuing STEM-related ALPs. However, teachers are expected to take over lessons this year.</p>
<p>Before the start of any lesson, the teachers try out the activities for themselves and do some troubleshooting to ensure the correct outcomes. &ldquo;We have an ongoing preview session where teachers come together and watch as the STEM educator carries out a demonstration. In a way, we are undergoing training as well. We are all new to FSciTech,&rdquo; says Mr Lee.</p>
<p><strong>Real world results</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear the programme&rsquo;s first objective of helping students experience real world applications is showing signs of success. While Lee has cut down on eating fast food, her classmate, Cheah Siew Mun, also 14, now takes special care not to keep food in the freezer for too long after a lesson on freezer burn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I learned that freezer burn reduces the nutrients in food,&rdquo; says Cheah. &ldquo;Before learning about it in class, I wouldn&rsquo;t know about it and I wouldn&rsquo;t care, but now I know we&rsquo;re not supposed to keep things for too long in the freezer because it will reduce the amount of nutrients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second objective of the programme, which is to get students to consider FSciTech as a future option, is also bearing fruit. &ldquo;I used to think I want to be a doctor. Now that I know about food science, I started looking into it as an option,&rdquo; says Lee.</p>
<p>Cheah agrees: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very interested in science and I&rsquo;m also interested in food. I think working in the industry can be very fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Enjoying hands-on learning</strong></p>
<p>The concept of ALP has caught on very well with the students. &ldquo;I thought it would be just another theory-based subject but it was different and more hands-on so it was more exciting,&rdquo; says Cheah. &ldquo;And I began to look forward to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to think food is just food,&rdquo; says Lee. &ldquo;Going through ALP has made me change my thinking. You have to think about where the food comes from, and some use technology and chemicals, which is related to science, which is a subject I really like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both students agree that their favourite part of ALP is the hands-on activities. &ldquo;The class is another break time for me because it&rsquo;s very relaxing. You get to learn about something new and different. My favourite part is the experiments &ndash; watching the teacher demonstrate how to do it and showing us different stuff,&rdquo; says Cheah.</p>
<p>Their least favourite part? The theory portions.</p>
<p><strong>Plans for the future</strong></p>
<p>The programme is still relatively new and the teachers are planning more and better things for the future. For example, they are looking at opportunities for Secondary 3 students to get out of school and visit industry partners to expose them to possible careers.</p>
<p>Another potential idea being bandied about is a school caf&eacute; venture where students can work on improving the quality of fruit juice. &ldquo;Perhaps our students can look into how to make the product better. Maybe brand it and market it in Dunearn caf&eacute; and be an entrepreneur. We want them to think about how they can further apply their knowledge. We also want them to explore like young scientists in a safe environment with the guidance of teachers,&rdquo; says Mr Lee.</p>
