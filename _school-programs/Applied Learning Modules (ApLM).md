<p><strong>The Applied Learning Module (ApLM) </strong>aims to provide students
with practical, hands-on experiences that enable them to apply their knowledge
in real-world contexts. At Dunearn, students will have the opportunity
to participate in an ApLM during Secondary 3.</p>
<p>ApLMs are thoughtfully selected to serve students’ best interests and
support their growth and aspirations. This approach not only helps to develop
students’ portfolios but also equips them with valuable skills that can
be shown in their academic and career pathways.</p>

<h4><strong>ApLM 2025</strong></h4>
<p>Below are the ApLMs our Secondary 3 students have participated this year:</p>
<p><strong>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction to Food Innovation at Singapore Polytechnic</strong>
</p>
<p>Students were given the opportunity to immerse themselves in the world
of the food technology industry. They gained valuable knowledge in areas
such as food safety, sensory analysis, and the science behind formulating
popular food products. From crafting health-conscious, sensory-enhanced
ice cream recipe to perfecting croissants with ideal textures and flavors,
students were provided with an in-depth understanding of how innovation
and technology shaped the future of food production.</p>

<p><em>“I learnt about the types of packaging and how different ingredients may affect the final product. I learnt how to work effectively and efficiently in groups. I enjoyed the hands-on experience with the guidance from the lecturers. I am greatly appreciative with the opportunity to join this module.” - Kaeden Chong</em>
</p>
<p><strong>2)&nbsp;Coding for Artificial Intelligence</strong>
</p>
<p>Students were introduced to the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning through hands-on coding in Python. In this ApLM, they had the
chance to experience the fun of coding in Python and learned how to train
an AI model in Machine Learning to recognise different food items such
as burgers and noodles. Through this experience, they gained insights into
how AI technologies work and impact everyday life, while developing curiosity,
creativity, and problem-solving skills.</p>
