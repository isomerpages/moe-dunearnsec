<h4><strong>What is Cyber Wellness?</strong></h4>
<p>Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users.
It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to
protect oneself and others from cyber risks such as excessive internet
use and cyber bullying.</p>
<p>In Dunearn Secondary School, we believe that it is important for students
to be equipped with the necessary life-long knowledge, social-emotional
competencies and sound values so that they can become safe, respectful
and responsible users of the internet. At the same time, they should also
share the knowledge and spread the key Cyber Wellness messages so everyone
in the community can participate safely online.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Cyber Wellness Messages&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Embrace the affordances of technology while
maintaining a balanced lifestyle between online and offline activities.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be a safe and responsible user of technology
and maintain a positive online presence.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be responsible for personal well-being in the
cyberspace.</p>
<h4><strong>Cyber Wellness Framework in Dunearn</strong></h4>
<p>Guided by MOE’s Cyber wellness Framework, Dunearn Secondary School focuses
on developing the students’ instinct to protect themself and empower them
to take responsibility for their own wellbeing in cyberspace through a
3-step process.&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Sense</strong>&nbsp;– Students should be able to “sense” any harm
when they are exposed to any danger or risk in cyberspace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Think&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;– Students should be able to analyse
and evaluate issues related to Cyber Wellness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Act</strong>&nbsp;– Students should be able to apply what they
have learnt to become responsible users when they are online.</p>
</li>
</ul>
