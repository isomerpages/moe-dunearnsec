<h4>What is Cyber Wellness?</h4>
<p>Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself and others from cyber risks such as excessive internet use and cyber bullying.</p>
<p>In Dunearn Secondary School, we believe that it is important for students to be equipped with the necessary life-long knowledge, social-emotional competencies and sound values so that they can become safe, respectful and responsible users of the internet. At the same time, they should also share the knowledge and spread the key Cyber Wellness messages so everyone in the community can participate safely online.</p>
<p>The school will partner parents in the process of inculcating Cyber Wellness values in their children by helping parents to understand cyber wellness issues and risks, as well as involving parents in reinforcing Cyber Wellness principles at home.</p>
<h4><strong>Cyber Wellness Framework in Dunearn</strong></h4>

<h4>The 3 Principles of Cyber Wellness</h4>
<p>The focus of CW is about helping students to become responsible digital learners, guided by the following principles:</p>
<p><strong>1. Respect for Self and Others</strong></p>
<p>Students should:</p>
<ul>
<li>uphold their own dignity when online (e.g. share appropriate content and participate only in legal online activities)</li>
<li>respect other people online (e.g. put themselves in others&rsquo; shoes, accept diverse views and opinions, give credit when using other people&rsquo;s work and seek permission where necessary, avoid sharing hurtful materials).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Safe and Responsible Use</strong></p>
<p>Students should:</p>
<ul>
<li>have an understanding of the risks of harmful and illegal online behaviour, and take steps to protect themselves (e.g. keep their personal information private, verify the reliability of information using various sources, take steps to avoid dangers they may encounter online).</li>
<li>make wise and healthy choices (e.g. maintain a healthy balance of their online and offline activities)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Positive Peer Influence</strong></p>
<p>Students should:</p>
<ul>
<li>be a positive role model online (e.g. share healthy and positive content, harness the affordances of technology to do good for society)</li>
<li>advocate positive online behaviour (e.g. stand up for their peers online, report cases of cyber bullying to a trusted adult/authority, post encouraging remarks on social media)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>The Approach</u></strong></p>
<p>Students will learn to infuse the following 3-step process when they engage in cyber activities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sense</strong> &ndash; Students should be able to &ldquo;sense&rdquo; any harm when they are exposed to any danger or risk in the cyber world</li>
<li><strong>Think&nbsp;</strong> &ndash; Students should be able to analyse and evaluate issues related to Cyber Wellness</li>
<li><strong>Act</strong> &ndash; Students should be able to apply what they have learnt to become responsible users when they are online</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>The Programme</u></strong></p>
<p>Our vision is to develop Dunearnites to be responsible online users who also have positive online influence. To do so, we have a 3-pronged approach:</p>

<p><strong><u>Cyber Wellness Curriculum</u></strong></p>

<p>The key messages for students are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Embrace technology yet maintain a balanced lifestyle between the physical and cyber worlds</li>
<li>Harness the power of ICT for positive purposes</li>
<li>Be a safe and responsible user of ICT</li>
<li>Be responsible for personal well-being in cyberspace</li>
<li>Maintain a positive presence in cyberspace</li>
