<p>NCC has a comprehensive leadership competency model (refer to NCC LCM Manual under Training&nbsp;page) that is infused in the NCC activities to ensure cadets&rsquo; are equipped with the leadership skills at&nbsp;the end of the 4-5 years in NCC. This leadership competency model is currently undergoing review in&nbsp;ensuring that it remains relevant to the changing needs of the 21st cadets.</p>

Physical Training usually consists of calisthenics, led by a Physical Training Instructor&nbsp;(PTI), himself usually a Specialist who is trained in this field by his seniors or C/offr.</p>
